                    This literature is about relation between weather change and indefinite complaint.<br>
                    The experiment was conducted to clarify the relation of them. In the survey,<br>
                    subjects were questioned some questions such as about condition on bad weather day.<br>
                    About 40% of subjects answered that their condition are bad on bad weather day and<br>
                    there are barely difference about sex. There are significant differences in a few<br>
                    questions. For instance, the number of subjects who have many times having headache<br>
                    in daily life, and have meteoropathy is significant larger than the number of subjects<br>
                    who do not have meteoropathy. That experiment clarified that approximately half of subjects<br>
                    have indefinite complaint by change weather. Some factors like sex, inner ear sensor do not have<br>
                    impact on indefinite complaint<br>
