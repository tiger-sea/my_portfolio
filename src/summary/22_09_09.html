                    This thesis is about effect on human response while bathing<br>
                    in several conditions. The experiments are conducted with 4 conditions,<br>
                    38ºC-abdomen, 38ºC-chest, 40ºC-chest, and 42ºC-chest to measure<br>
                    skin temperature, rectal temperature, heart rate, sweat rate, and blood pressure.<br>
                    The skin temperature and rectal temperature results were higher<br>
                    as water temperature was higher. The heart rate results were high<br>
                    while bathing 40ºC and 42ºC. They were barely affected by water amount.<br>
                    The blood pressure while rest after bathing is lower than while bathing.<br>
                    The sweat rate results were higher while bathing 40ºC and 42ºC, and<br>
                    as temperature was high, the results were high while bathing. Subjects who<br>
                    are larger BMI took longer bath time. In addition, Subjects whose heart<br>
                    rate is usually high took shorter bath time.
